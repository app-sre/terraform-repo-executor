## Config file
The application processes the yaml/json defined at `CONFIG_FILE` for determining targets. The attributes are as follows:

|---|---|---|
| `dry_run` | boolean | If `true`, the application executes `terraform plan`; if `false`, the application executes `terraform apply`. |

| &emsp;`name` | string | A custom name for the repository, used as an identifier throughout the application. |
| &emsp;`ref` | string | Commit sha in the repository to be targeted. |
| &emsp;`project_path` | string | Relative path to the terraform workspace within the repository. |
| &emsp;`delete` | boolean | If `true`, the application will execute the terraform action with the `destroy` flag set |
| &emsp;`require_fips` | boolean | If `true` then the executor will validate the generated plan to ensure that AWS is using FIPS endpoints |
| &emsp;`bucket` | string | Optional S3 bucket name to store Terraform state in |
| &emsp;`bucket_path` | string | Optional path of where to store specific Terraform state files in |
| &emsp;`region` | string | AWS region of where the S3 bucket is stored |
| &emsp;`secret` | object | Vault secret where the terraform credentials for specified account are stored. |
